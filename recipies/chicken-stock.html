    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's easy, thrifty, and will make your kitchen smell amazing.</p>
    <p>Chicken stock is a base for soups and sauces, and adds flavor and richness to rice dishes, stews, and pastas. You can buy ready-made chicken stock at the grocery story, but it's worth it to learn how to make your own. It's an easy, money-saving way to use up chicken carcasses from roast chicken or chicken parts left over from cutting up a whole chicken. And when you chop up onions, carrots, and celery for other recipes, you can save and freeze the unused parts to flavor your homemade stock. Save money and make the tastiest chicken stock? We're in!</p>
